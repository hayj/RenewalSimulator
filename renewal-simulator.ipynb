    "Clicks are generated by user over 30 news diplayed : 15 news from one recsys and 15 other news from another. Actually it's more complicated because we can have duplicates, but for this simulation, we consider the simple case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each 4 days window (`days_window`), we re-assign user to systems. A user will click on news 2 times per day (`nb_matchs_per_day_per_user`), wich means it will click on news on 60 news (2 buckets or recommendations).\n",
    "`nb_windows` is the number of time period we will run (with re-assignments).\n",

    "The score of a system is the probability it will win another random system.\n",
    "The score is a latent variable we know for the simulation, usefull to get result of a 1vs1. It is not known in a real competition.\n",
    "The worst system will have a score of 0.3 (`recsys_start_win_prob`) and the best will have a score of 0.8 (`recsys_end_win_prob`). The more scores of system are close, the more we'll need matchs to get a good ranking of systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better respect users behavior, we can randomize users usage of the app per day.\n",
    "We removed this because we need consistant number of events per window to plot the curve.\n",
    "For exemple, with `max_nb_matchs_per_day_per_user = 4`, a user, one day, will generate a match 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 times.\n",
    "0 means the user didn't use the app this day.\n",
    "4 means he used the app a lot this day, this will generate 4 matchs.\n",

    "This project doesn't seem to fit our requirements: [The GitHub repo](https://github.com/reinhardh/supplement_approximate_ranking/blob/master/approximate_ranking_introduction.ipynb), [The paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.01253.pdf)).\n",
